Repository for the group project in P3: Erweiterungsmodul for CL

Group 11: Analyzing multilingual performance of the family of BLIP-2 models on the WIT dataset \
Luca Blicks, Anita Guseinova, Julius Kroi√ü

## Project structure
**root** directory: introductory and final presentation \
**root/src**: all the notebook files we created for the project, we tried to keep the names clear \
**root/src/data**: WIT dataset, after preprocessing. The original is found at https://github.com/google-research-datasets/wit/blob/main/DATA.md as "1% data sample file" and was too heavy to upload here \
**root/src/results**: the results of data evaluation \
**root/src/old**: the old results of data evaluation used in presentation - then we reran the scripts again for double-check.
